            Even when the website layout is commissioned to a designer, and the result may seem pretty good, there are still things that can be corrected and will radically change the user experience.</br></br>
            I'm talking about <span class="p-bold">selling or not selling. Receiving a call or not.</span> If no designer was involved, I may have to redesign it from scratch. With respect for the original idea.

              It's the core anatomy of all the website functions. The use of just a CMS like Wordpress, without further intervention, leads to a<span class="p-bold"> bad performing online business</span>. 
            </br></br>But even if a professional developer was involved, probably all efforts were on functions and client's requests, not on the lightening speed you need to be<span class="p-bold"> truly competitive</span>.
            </br></br>Other common problems are bad mobile development, too much plugins/useless functions, coding as in early 2000's, paying no attention on uploaded media, and many many more.

                Every website needs a marketing strategy to create traffic towards it. Most of the time, this is more important than the website itself.
